{"name":"Screet Reboot","tagline":"Feminist, queer and women-centric, sex-positive access to sexual health products and information","body":"### Welcome to Screet Reboot!\r\nThis is a project to reboot [Screet](http://screet.ninja), an app that aimed to provide on-demand discreet delivery of sexual health products. It was originally created as part of [Startup Bus](http://startupbus.com), an intense 3-day road-trip-meets-hackathon. Now that StartupBus is over and the original team is dissolving, we're planning to reboot it with a new team and new focus.\r\n\r\n### Core Functionality\r\n* Easy ordering of sexual health products via web or mobile app\r\n* Dispatch to drivers - the original plan involved borrowing trunk space of Uber and Lyft drivers on the road, but this can be adapted\r\n* Discreet tamper-proof packaging that only has SKUs so that the delivery person does not know what exactly is being delivered\r\n* Anonymous delivery (the driver doesn't need to interact with you if you don't want them to)\r\n* Providers that understand the specific sexual health needs of specific demographics and can cater to them\r\n\r\n### Products Offered\r\n* Original Screet: Offered condoms, lube, gloves, and a \"Party Pack\" of the above; condoms were what we used for our initial marketing launch\r\n* Plan B: the spark of this idea. Being authorized as a supplier of Plan B turns out to be a more involved process than expected (the manufacturer has strict processes), but with the advent of OTC and generic Plan B this may be easier to manage\r\n* Wishlist items: Dental dams, sex toys, PReP, sex-related media, educational material, generic medication (aspirin, etc)\r\n\r\n### Progress So Far\r\n* [Landing page](http://screet.ninja)\r\n* [Demo ordering system](http://m.screet.ninja) built on Meteor ([see old code here](https://github.com/ScreetReboot/OldScreet) - so far \r\n* Branding\r\n* Social media accounts on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/screetapp), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/screetapp), and [Tumblr](http://screetapp.tumblr.com) as well as mailing list\r\n* [Market research survey](https://github.com/ScreetReboot/ScreetSurveyData/blob/master/Market%20Research%20Survey-report%20(1).xlsx) - about 70 respondents\r\n* Write-ups on [Feministing](http://feministing.com/2015/06/08/meet-screet-a-feminist-sexual-health-app/) and [Bustle](http://www.bustle.com/articles/89019-4-sexual-health-apps-you-should-know-about-because-everyone-deserves-to-be-having-amazing-sex)\r\n* Research on white-labeling for product and/or software\r\n* Communication with various community organizations on potential partnerships\r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\n* Actual supply of Plan B, PReP, RU-486, other medication\r\n* Sliding-scale/free options for low-income folks\r\n* On-demand sexual health advice/hotline (perhaps partnering with [San Francisco Sex Information](http://sfsi.org/)?)\r\n* Intersectional advisory board & team across genders, sexualities, nationalities, race, ability, class, etc\r\n* Partnerships with local sexuality businesses\r\n* Dedicated delivery people\r\n\r\n### Help Needed\r\n* Forming teams across skill-sets (technical, business, community development, design, marketing, etc) and demographics\r\n* Building equity agreements and set up business structure\r\n* Rebuilding or building on the Meteor app - we especially need to work out the driver dispatch & tracking system\r\n* New brand name with websites & social media accounts to match\r\n* Research on funding opportunities - investment, grants, etc\r\n* Project management tools\r\n* Renegotiating with Teva (manufacturers of Plan B) or generics manufacturers\r\n* Negotiating with suppliers, retailers, and manufacturers of safer sex products\r\n* Partnering with community organizations, health providers, activists\r\n* Working out a driver recruitment, screening, and dispatch process\r\n* Further market research\r\n* Publicity, press, outreach\r\n* Anything else at all!\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n* Email: *screetreboot-at-gmail-dot-com*\r\n* [Mailing list](http://github.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=75c4454873625c17e7af45e52&id=0767b98555)\r\n","google":"UA-63977620-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
